      <p>For the last five years, the world has been living the worst humanitarian crises since World War II. From small countries in Asia, through different regions in Africa, to once rich, peaceful, and prosperous countries like Venezuela more and more people are living their places or origins. Citing UNHCR Global Trends 2017 report “It means the world’s forcibly displaced population has now overtaken that of the United Kingdom and reached another record high”. But what is it that force them to leave their home and loves ones, besides the wars and conflicts going on in some of these countries?<p>

      <h2 class="subhead">Where are the largest forcibly displaced populations from?</h2>

      <p>Without a doubt, Syrians are in the center of the biggest humanitarian and human rights crises taking place recently. About 13 million people, including men, women, and children, have fled their country’s civil war. Although officially no longer in crisis, Colombians are the second largest population forcibly displaced, with almost eight million people having flee their country in the last decade due to terror acts caused by the guerrillas. The Congolese population come in the unfortunate third place. More than five million people fled the Democratic Republic of Congo after a decades long conflict. The same number applies for the Afghans that have been forcibly displaced from their home fearing the Taliban regime and the recent wars that haven taken place in the country.<p>

      <p>Per reported by UNHCR “other large displaced populations included people from Iraq (4.8 million), South Sudan (4.4 million), Somalia (3.2 million), Sudan (3.1 million), Yemen (2.1 million), Nigeria (2.7 million), and Ukraine (2.0 million)”. According to this information, most of the forcibly displaced populations are from East African and Middle Eastern countries.<p>

      <p>According to 2018 preliminary figures, more than 3 million Venezuelans have fled their country and thousands are fleeing Myanmar and Central America (Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua).<p>       
      
      <h2 class="subhead">Welfare conditions: GDP per Capita vs. Human Development Index</h2>

      <p>In an effort to measure the overall welfare of the populations in these countries, we made a scatter plot for which we used GDP per Capita and the Human Development Index as the two variables to consider. The conclusion was very clear: of the 12 countries mentioned above, eight are among the 100 countries with the lowest GDP per Capita (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Ukraine, Sudan, Iraq, and Colombia), and of these, four are among the 50 countries with the lowest GDP per capita in the world. The remaining four countries, South Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Venezuela have no data available, most likely, because the lack of appropriate governance is preventing this level of accountability.<p>

      <p>Consequently, and not surprising, nine out of the 12 countries with the most displaced population, ranked in the bottom 50 in the Human Development Index (South Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan, Nigeria, Syria, and Ukraine). Somalia doesn’t have reported data, and Colombia and Venezuela ranked among the middle with 0.75 and 0.76 respectively.<p>
